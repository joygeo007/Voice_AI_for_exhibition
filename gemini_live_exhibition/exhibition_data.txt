# Exhibition Title: The Odyssey of Code: From Abacus to AI

## Introduction
Welcome to "The Odyssey of Code," a journey through the history and future of computing. This exhibition explores how humanity has built machines to think, calculate, and dream.

## Section 1: The Pioneers (Room A)
- **The Antikythera Mechanism (150 BC)**: Often called the first analog computer, used by ancient Greeks to predict astronomical positions.
- **Ada Lovelace & The Analytical Engine (1843)**: Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer. She wrote an algorithm for Charles Babbage's mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, realizing it could do more than just math.
- **ENIAC (1945)**: The first electronic general-purpose digital computer. It filled an entire room (1,800 sq ft) and used 18,000 vacuum tubes.

## Section 2: The Silicon Revolution (Room B)
- **The Transistor (1947)**: Invented at Bell Labs, this tiny switch replaced bulky vacuum tubes, paving the way for modern electronics.
- **The Personal Computer Era (1970s-80s)**: The Apple II and IBM PC brought computing into homes. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) changed how we interact with machines forever.
- **The Internet (1990s)**: The World Wide Web, invented by Tim Berners-Lee, connected the globe.

## Section 3: The Age of AI (Main Hall)
- **Machine Learning**: Computers learning from data without explicit programming.
- **Neural Networks**: Inspired by the human brain, these layered algorithms drive today's AI breakthroughs.
- **Generative AI**: Models like Gemini that can create text, images, and code. This very station is powered by such technology!

## Interactive Station: The "Emotion Detector"
- Located in the corner of the Main Hall.
- Uses computer vision to analyze facial expressions in real-time.
- Demonstrates how AI can interpret human non-verbal communication.

## Fun Facts
- The first computer bug was a literal moth found trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947.
- There are more possible iterations of a game of chess than there are atoms in the observable universe.
- The Apollo 11 guidance computer had less processing power than a modern toaster.

## Emergency Info
- Restrooms are located near the entrance of Room A.
- The cafeteria is on the second floor.
- In case of emergency, follow the green exit signs to the nearest stairwell.
